<!-- Our Story Section -->
<section class="about-story">
    <h2>Our Story</h2><br></br>
    <p>The journey of Cre Corner began when our founder was just in the 10th grade, driven by a love for creating jewelry as a hobby. As a young 20-year-old entrepreneur, I've since expanded my knowledge, honed my skills, and transformed that initial passion into a thriving business. What started as a small personal project has grown into a brand that celebrates creativity and individuality. My journey is about more than just making products; it's about building a platform to inspire other young women to explore their entrepreneurial dreams and find their own creative paths.
